                <h3>Seize the Space with Strategy & Consulting</h3>
                <p>The traditional sequence from customer needs to strategy to technology execution is too long, too limited and too risky. Strategy should be informed by an understanding of business capability from Day One. Similarly, technology execution and transformation that isnâ€™t governed by thoughtful strategic context is equally dangerous. To truly accelerate growth and effectiveness through digital business transformation requires the fusion of customer experience, strategy and consulting and technology engineering and execution.</p>
